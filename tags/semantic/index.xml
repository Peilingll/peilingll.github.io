&lt;p&gt;The project is designed to capture and process real-time spatial data of the built environment by integrating advanced sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and an RGB-D camera, onto a robotic platform. These sensors work in unison to collect high-quality spatial and visual data, which is then seamlessly streamed using the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS facilitates the efficient handling of sensor data, enabling real-time processing through advanced algorithms that reconstruct the environment&amp;rsquo;s geometry with precision. By combining robotics, state-of-the-art sensors, advanced point cloud processing techniques, and real-time computation, the project aims to provide accurate and dynamic spatial mapping solutions, offering a robust foundation for applications in fields such as architecture, urban planning, and autonomous navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>BIM.Fundamentals Modeling Task</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project7/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is the core practical assignment for the &amp;ldquo;BIM.Fundamentals&amp;rdquo; course in the Summer Term 2025 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), School of Engineering and Design. The project aims to deeply explore the potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and to master the IFC data schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This task requires the creation of a detailed, semantically enriched BIM model that adheres to specific shape requirements. The model&amp;rsquo;s structure, appearance, and material definitions must be strictly defined, ensuring semantic accuracy and data consistency throughout the development process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
