&lt;p&gt;The project is designed to capture and process real-time spatial data of the built environment by integrating advanced sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and an RGB-D camera, onto a robotic platform. These sensors work in unison to collect high-quality spatial and visual data, which is then seamlessly streamed using the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS facilitates the efficient handling of sensor data, enabling real-time processing through advanced algorithms that reconstruct the environment&amp;rsquo;s geometry with precision. By combining robotics, state-of-the-art sensors, advanced point cloud processing techniques, and real-time computation, the project aims to provide accurate and dynamic spatial mapping solutions, offering a robust foundation for applications in fields such as architecture, urban planning, and autonomous navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
