&lt;p&gt;The project is designed to capture and process real-time spatial data of the built environment by integrating advanced sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and an RGB-D camera, onto a robotic platform. These sensors work in unison to collect high-quality spatial and visual data, which is then seamlessly streamed using the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS facilitates the efficient handling of sensor data, enabling real-time processing through advanced algorithms that reconstruct the environment&amp;rsquo;s geometry with precision. By combining robotics, state-of-the-art sensors, advanced point cloud processing techniques, and real-time computation, the project aims to provide accurate and dynamic spatial mapping solutions, offering a robust foundation for applications in fields such as architecture, urban planning, and autonomous navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Indoor Ambient Monitoring</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is about developing an Indoor Ambient Monitoring system to manage and visualize human comfort relevant environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, illuminance, noise level, CO2 concentration, and others in an indoor environment. Further, the task is to study an insight on LoRaWAN Indoor Network Coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="methods"&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system architecture is divided into hardware and software components. On the hardware side, multiple indoor environmental sensors (measuring CO, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, etc.) transmit data via LoRa using the CayenneLPP encoding format through a LoRaWAN gateway to IoT cloud platforms such as TTN and SWM. On the software side, these platforms forward the data to the FROST Server via the standardized SensorThings API, where it is stored in MongoDB. Meanwhile, the semantic building model of TUM in CityGML LOD 3.0 is processed with FME and converted into Cesium-compatible 3D Tiles. Finally, JavaScript is used to fetch live or historical data from the FROST Server and MongoDB, integrating it into Cesium 3D visualizations and interactive dashboards for end-user applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Duration and Target Dates – Fundamentals</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experimental report is part of the System-Theoretical Principles of Project Management course, focusing on how system-theoretical methods can be applied to analyze project scheduling and verify the impact of different strategies on project duration and resource allocation. We began by modeling project activities as a causal network and conducting scheduling analysis to identify the critical path and overall project duration, which served as the baseline for subsequent scenario comparisons. We then designed and compared three different scheduling strategies to examine how variations in resource allocation influence project duration and constrained conditions. Finally, we simulated different scheduling flexibility settings by adjusting the strength of boundary conditions to observe the effects of task concentration versus dispersion, thereby exploring their impact on project stability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Terra Vein</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was carried out in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://xrhub-bavaria.de/"&gt;XR HUB Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on the production of an animation themed around future energy. The final work was showcased in the dome theater at &lt;a href="https://www.1e9.community/festival-der-zukunft/2025/deutsch"&gt;1E9 &amp;amp; Festival der Zukunft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="geothermal-energy"&gt;Geothermal Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike solar or wind, geothermal energy reveals itself in a tangible way—rising as steam from beneath the Earth, a direct expression of its deep heat. It’s not only a sustainable choice but also a profound connection to the planet’s elemental forces. Our vision contrasts the soft, ethereal plumes of steam with the structured pipes that carry it—symbolizing harmony between nature and engineering. Geothermal represents a livable, powerful rhythm of the Earth, shaping a future where cities breathe in sync with nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>BIM.Fundamentals Modeling Task</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project7/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was part of the SS25 BIM Fundamental Course, aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the structure of the IFC schema. The assignment required us to create a semantically enriched and detailed BIM model, acting simultaneously as designers and engineers. We carefully examined the structure, appearance, and material definitions of the model, ensuring semantic accuracy and consistency throughout. This process not only strengthened our modeling skills but also provided us with a solid foundation in comprehending the logic and framework of IFC-based data representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Constraints Design in Timber Modular Process</title><link>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilingsong.org/projects/project6/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was developed during the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaec.com/events.html"&gt;2024 AEC Hackathon Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and collabrated with &lt;a href="https://www.tum-venture-labs.de/labs/built-environment/"&gt;TUM Venture Lab Built Environment&lt;/a&gt;. We proposed a &lt;strong&gt;Constraint Design (CD)&lt;/strong&gt; model, introducing an intermediate abstract layer that integrates manufacturing and MEP requirements early in the design phase. By embedding constraints upfront, the approach reduces redesign efforts, improves collaboration and efficiency..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dreso.com/de/"&gt;Drees &amp;amp; Sommer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focused on timber modular design, where misaligned details between designers and manufacturers often cause costly redesigns. Our goal was to create an &lt;strong&gt;abstract intermediate model&lt;/strong&gt; that simplifies data exchange and coordination.&lt;br&gt;
