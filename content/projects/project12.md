## Checking Tasks

# Door Clearance Check
- Detect doors where clearance requirements are not fulfilled due to nearby furniture.  
- Suggest repositioning or resizing furniture to restore accessibility.  

# Window Area Ratio Check
- Ensure window-to-space area ratio does not exceed 50% in office spaces.  
- Adjust window sizing or space planning to meet the requirement.  

# Space Accessibility Check
- Identify office spaces that are completely inaccessible.  
- Provide alternative circulation or openings to ensure accessibility.  

# Space Area Check
- Check confidential meeting rooms smaller than 5 m².  
- Increase room size to comply with functional requirements.  

# Wrong Property Set Check
- Detect inner walls incorrectly marked as external (`IsExternal = true`).  
- Correct property assignment for accurate building envelope definition.
