## Introduction
This project was carried out in collaboration with [XR HUB Bavaria](https://xrhub-bavaria.de/), focusing on the production of an animation themed around future energy. The final work was showcased in the dome theater at [1E9 & Festival der Zukunft](https://www.1e9.community/festival-der-zukunft/2025/deutsch).

## Geothermal Energy
Unlike solar or wind, geothermal energy reveals itself in a tangible way—rising as steam from beneath the Earth, a direct expression of its deep heat. It’s not only a sustainable choice but also a profound connection to the planet’s elemental forces. Our vision contrasts the soft, ethereal plumes of steam with the structured pipes that carry it—symbolizing harmony between nature and engineering. Geothermal represents a livable, powerful rhythm of the Earth, shaping a future where cities breathe in sync with nature.

## Story Board
The narrative is composed of a series of distinct 
vignettes, each showcasing a different aspect 
of life in the geothermal city. These scenes 
are woven together by a recurring visual 
motif: a transition that follows the journey of 
the energy through the city‘s intricate network 
of pipes.

## Modeling

We prioritized flexibility and efficiency by combining different tools: Blender for asset creation and animation, Rhino for precise parametric modeling, and Marvelous Designer for textiles. A camera-first approach focused detail only where visible, saving time and resources.

The key visual element—ethereal steam—was created in Blender with particle systems and metaballs, giving it a soft, cotton-like look and dynamic flow.

Final editing was done in Premiere Pro, integrating rendered sequences, an AI-generated score, ambient sounds, and color grading to unify the visual tone.
