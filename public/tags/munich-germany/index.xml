      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of architecture, &lt;strong&gt;“comfort” and “energy efficiency” are often seen as conflicting goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for nearly &lt;strong&gt;40% of a building’s total energy use&lt;/strong&gt;. Reducing energy consumption without compromising occupant comfort is therefore a complex and urgent challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently read and reviewed a study on a &lt;strong&gt;Digital Twin (DT) + BIM + IoT framework&lt;/strong&gt;, where the key focus was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;➔ How to dynamically optimize indoor thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption through open-source platforms, real-time sensing, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project is to classify dominant tree species across Germany by leveraging satellite image time series. Forest management practices benefit from knowledge of species distribution, which supports site-adapted tree selection and climate-resilient forest planning. Tree species labels in the TreeSatAI dataset are organised hierarchically (leaf type, genus, species), allowing us to develop classification methods that exploit this structure to improve model performance. We integrate Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery (10 spectral bands, 5 vegetation indices) into a data processing pipeline that extracts monthly composites (March–October 2022) and generates 5×5 pixel patches for each reference point. We trained and evaluated five classification models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformer architectures.Hierarchical labels (L1, L2) significantly improved accuracy both traditional machine learning and deep learning models(CNN, RNN). Furthermore, data augmentation with rotation and translation enhanced the generalisation ability of deep learning models. Among all methods, XGBoost achieved the highest test accuracy (83.6%)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project is designed to capture and process real-time spatial data of the built environment by integrating advanced sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and an RGB-D camera, onto a robotic platform. These sensors work in unison to collect high-quality spatial and visual data, which is then seamlessly streamed using the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS facilitates the efficient handling of sensor data, enabling real-time processing through advanced algorithms that reconstruct the environment&amp;rsquo;s geometry with precision. By combining robotics, state-of-the-art sensors, advanced point cloud processing techniques, and real-time computation, the project aims to provide accurate and dynamic spatial mapping solutions, offering a robust foundation for applications in fields such as architecture, urban planning, and autonomous navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indoor Ambient Monitoring</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/project2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project is about developing an Indoor Ambient Monitoring system to manage and visualize human comfort relevant environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, illuminance, noise level, CO2 concentration, and others in an indoor environment. Further, the task is to study an insight on LoRaWAN Indoor Network Coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/pj2-1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Dashboard&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xmruuu.github.io/25SS_IoT_Indoor-Ambient-Monitoring/&#34;&gt;Open Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods&#34;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system architecture is divided into hardware and software components. On the hardware side, multiple indoor environmental sensors (measuring CO, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, etc.) transmit data via LoRa using the CayenneLPP encoding format through a LoRaWAN gateway to IoT cloud platforms such as TTN and SWM. On the software side, these platforms forward the data to the FROST Server via the standardized SensorThings API, where it is stored in MongoDB. Meanwhile, the semantic building model of TUM in CityGML LOD 3.0 is processed with FME and converted into Cesium-compatible 3D Tiles. Finally, JavaScript is used to fetch live or historical data from the FROST Server and MongoDB, integrating it into Cesium 3D visualizations and interactive dashboards for end-user applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scheduling Duration and Target Dates – Fundamentals</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/project5/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This experimental report is part of the System-Theoretical Principles of Project Management course, focusing on how system-theoretical methods can be applied to analyze project scheduling and verify the impact of different strategies on project duration and resource allocation. We began by modeling project activities as a causal network and conducting scheduling analysis to identify the critical path and overall project duration, which served as the baseline for subsequent scenario comparisons. We then designed and compared three different scheduling strategies to examine how variations in resource allocation influence project duration and constrained conditions. Finally, we simulated different scheduling flexibility settings by adjusting the strength of boundary conditions to observe the effects of task concentration versus dispersion, thereby exploring their impact on project stability and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project was carried out in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://xrhub-bavaria.de/&#34;&gt;XR HUB Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on the production of an animation themed around future energy. The final work was showcased in the dome theater at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.1e9.community/festival-der-zukunft/2025/deutsch&#34;&gt;1E9 &amp;amp; Festival der Zukunft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/pj4.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Demo Animation&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cmBN1STj06-iLnF-wBkBNgyE_9a5LTmO/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Open Full Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;geothermal-energy&#34;&gt;Geothermal Energy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike solar or wind, geothermal energy reveals itself in a tangible way—rising as steam from beneath the Earth, a direct expression of its deep heat. It’s not only a sustainable choice but also a profound connection to the planet’s elemental forces. Our vision contrasts the soft, ethereal plumes of steam with the structured pipes that carry it—symbolizing harmony between nature and engineering. Geothermal represents a livable, powerful rhythm of the Earth, shaping a future where cities breathe in sync with nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/project7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project was part of the SS25 BIM Fundamental Course, aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the structure of the IFC schema. The assignment required us to create a semantically enriched and detailed BIM model, acting simultaneously as designers and engineers. We carefully examined the structure, appearance, and material definitions of the model, ensuring semantic accuracy and consistency throughout. This process not only strengthened our modeling skills but also provided us with a solid foundation in comprehending the logic and framework of IFC-based data representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project was developed during the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackaec.com/events.html&#34;&gt;2024 AEC Hackathon Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and collabrated with  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tum-venture-labs.de/labs/built-environment/&#34;&gt;TUM Venture Lab Built Environment&lt;/a&gt;. We proposed a &lt;strong&gt;Constraint Design (CD)&lt;/strong&gt; model, introducing an intermediate abstract layer that integrates manufacturing and MEP requirements early in the design phase. By embedding constraints upfront, the approach reduces redesign efforts, improves collaboration and efficiency..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;hackathon-topics&#34;&gt;Hackathon Topics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The challenge from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreso.com/de/&#34;&gt;Drees &amp;amp; Sommer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focused on timber modular design, where misaligned details between designers and manufacturers often cause costly redesigns. Our goal was to create an &lt;strong&gt;abstract intermediate model&lt;/strong&gt; that simplifies data exchange and coordination.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/pj6-6.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Dashboard&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.
